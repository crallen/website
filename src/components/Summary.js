            <p>
              I have been building software for over 15 years and I love it. I specialize in system
              design, backend development, and platform engineering. I have extensive experience
              building cloud infrastructure and implementing DevOps practices.

              When I&apos;m not working, I&apos;m spending time with my wife, son, and our dogs. We
              like to travel when we get the chance and I do a lot of cooking, which I&apos;ve
              turned into a hobby.
